The script WhereIsTitan.py was written to determine the coordinates of Titan in order to help the observation in he IDS Proposal SI2015a02 from the Isaac Newton Telescope in La Palma. 

It is possible to set the observation date:  
USAGE: WhereIsTitan.py ["YYYY/MM/DD hh:mm:ss"]
EXAMPLE: /home/inaki/WIT/WhereIsTitan.py "2015/07/15 22:30:05"

The scripts shows a table with the coordinates of Titan, checking if it is visible from the INT during a specific time, if it is necessary to raise the lower shuter, and if Titan is too much close to Saturn to allow to do an optimal observation. In addition on that, it shows the coordinates of the two solar analog to observe.
